# parking_sensor_by_canbus
This project is about a automatic parking proximity sensor system by CANBUS protocol, in order to alert the driver with LEDs and a buzzer.
In order to create the system by submiited codes, you need 3 Arduino and MCP2515 module, 2 LEDs and HCSR-04 Ultrasonix Proximity Sensor, and a buzzer.
Pay attention the connect the PINs as same as in uploaded codes. 2 Arduinos are used to get the proximity information from sensors. The last Arduino is used to give output with a buzzer and 2 LEDs.
